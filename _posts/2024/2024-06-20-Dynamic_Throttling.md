Dynamic Throttling 공부
연구실 논문

# Summary
Propose a novel recovery-aware dynamic throttling technique, called READY, which guarantees the SSD lifetime required by the enterprise market while exploiting the self-recovery effect of floating-gate transistors.  

# Scopes of Work
Limited and unpredictable lifetime of SSDs.  
SSDs in enterprise systems.  

# Motivation Problem
### > 

# Key Idea
### > Make throttling decisons dynamically based on the predicted future write demand of a workload
the required SSD lifetime can be guraneed with less performance dgradation.
